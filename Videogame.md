<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Vibrotactile Memory is a computer video game for timbre perception training in children with cochlear implants.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Timbre is one of the fundamental aspects of sound; it defines the <em>color</em> or <em>quality</em> of a sound and allows us to distinguish a voice from a violin, for instance. Cochlear implants struggle to represent complex sounds, and timbre identification is one of the limitations of these highly complex neuroprostheses.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>The game is inspired by classic memory games. The player has to match pairs of musical instrument sounds and vibrations based on their timbre. Once a pair is found, the cards are flipped, and the musical instrument is shown. The game is controlled with a PlayStation DualSense controller, which provides high-quality vibrotactile feedback. The game is designed to be scalable, allowing the player to start with a few sounds and increase the complexity as they progress.</p>

<h2>Who is involved?</h2>
<p>This project is part of my PhD at Aalborg Univeristy, in collaboration with the <a href="https://melcph.create.aau.dk">Multisensory Experience Lab at Aalborg University</a> and the <a href="https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/english/departments/centre-of-head-and-orthopaedics/department-of-otorhinolaryngology-head-and-neck-surgery-and-audiology/Centres-and-Units/Pages/Copenhagen-Hearing-and-Balance-Centre.aspx">Hearing and Balance Center at Rigshospitalet</a>. It is supervised by <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/107881">Prof. Stefania Serafin</a>, <a href="https://research.regionh.dk/da/persons/lone-marianne-percy-smith">Prof. Lone Percy-Smith</a>, and <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/adj">Assistant Prof. Ali Adjorlu</a>.</p>

<h2>What have I learned?</h2>
<p>I designed, developed, and programmed the software. I learned about haptics and vibrotactile feedback, videogame development, audio programming, participatory design, and data analysis.</p>

<h2>Can I see more?</h2>
<p>There is article that provides in-depth information about the Vibrotactile Memory video game. You can find it <a href="https://smcnetwork.org/smc2024/papers/SMC2024_paper_id109.pdf">here</a>.</p>
