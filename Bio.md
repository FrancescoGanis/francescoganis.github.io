				<p>I am an Italian PhD student at Aalborg University in Copenhagen.</p>
				<p>I attended a technical high school where I studied Electronics and Telecommunications, which helped me build a technical mindset and analytical thinking. These traits are still part of me.</p>
				<p>After a brief experience at an Engineering university, I decided to dive into the Sound Engineering field, combining my two main passions: music and technology. I had the opportunity to experience life as a sound technician in both the classical world during the day and the pop/rock scenes during the night. Additionally, I learned about electronic music and how to perform live mixing of such music.</p>
				<p>I also discovered the world of research, and thanks to my Professor Nicola Bernardini, I realized that a Master's degree in Sound and Music Computing would fit my interests and skills. Consequently, I moved to Copenhagen after being accepted into the master's program. I studied, among other things, Sound Processing, and Embodied Interaction, and developed more skills in embedded programming, research, and sound programming.</p>
				<p>After graduation, I applied for a PhD in the Department of Architecture, Design, and Media Technology and was accepted under the supervision of Professor Stefania Serafin. My PhD focuses on designing and developing training tools for children with hearing impairments to help them have a better experience with music.</p>
				<p>In my free time I play drums and take pictures. I have more than 20 years of experience on the drum stool, I played in different musical projects several genres spanning from Pop to Rhythm and Blues, and played theaters, pubs, festivals, etc.</p>
