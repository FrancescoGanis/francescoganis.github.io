<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Tickle Tuner is a haptic smartphone cover that provides high quality vibrotactile feedback. It is designed to help individuals with hearing loss to improve their experience of music and sound while using their smart devices. It has been proven to be also suitable for msucial training activities.</p>	

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Cochlear implants have been proven to be a successful treatment for severe hearing loss. However, they do not provide the same sound quality as natural hearing. This can make it difficult for users to enjoy complex sounds such as music. Tickle Tuner aims to improve the experience of music and sound for cochlear implant users by providing vibrotactile feedback that enhances the perception of sound.</p>

<h2>How it works?</h2>

<p>This prototype features a 3D-printed body and is equipped with two high fedelity voicecoil actuators to provide a powerful and accurate vibrotactile feedback. The smartphone can be connected to the cover through the USB-C port without installing any program. The Tickle Tuner has also an audio output to connect headphones or speakers using a 3.5mm jack. </p>

<p>To explore the possibilities offered by the Tickle Tuner, I developed a testbench app that allows separate control of audio and vibrotactile feedback. The app can generate simple sounds using a basic sequencer and envelope shaper, and it includes a pitch tracking algorithm to select specific features of the music played by the audio player. This app allowed to experiment and investigate what can be done with this prototype.</p>

<h2>Who is involved?</h2>
<p>This project is a collaboration between the <a href="https://melcph.create.aau.dk">Multisensory Experience Lab at Aalborg University</a> and Oticon Medical. It has been supervised by <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/107881">Prof. Stefania Serafin</a>, and Marianna Vatti</p>

<h2>Can I see more?</h2>
