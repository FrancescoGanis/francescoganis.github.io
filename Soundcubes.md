<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>SoundCubes is a prototype designed to train sound localization skills in children with hearing loss.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Sound localization is crucial for communication, enjoying music, and responding to emergencies. Children with hearing loss often struggle with this skill, leading to social isolation and poor academic performance. Research shows that spatial training can improve sound localization in those with severe hearing loss. SoundCubes offers an engaging and scalable training tool for these children.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/ChildPointCubes.jpg %}" alt="AI generated image of a child pointing at cubes"/><br><em style="display: block; text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em;">AI generated image</em></span></p>
<p>The child is surrounded by cubes, each with a loudspeaker. One cube plays a sound, and the child must identify and pick up the correct cube. The system provides feedback based on their choice. A therapist or parent controls the system via a smartphone, selecting sounds, difficulty levels, and monitoring performance. An automatic mode is also available.</p>

<h2>Who is involved?</h2>
<p>This project is part of my PhD, in collaboration with the <a href="https://melcph.create.aau.dk">Multisensory Experience Lab at Aalborg University</a> and the Hearing and Balance Center at Rigshospitalet. It is supervised by Prof. Stefania Serafin, Prof. Lone Percy-Smith, and Assistant Prof. Ali Adjorlu.</p>

<h2>Can I see more?</h2>
<p>The project is currently in the evaluation phase. More details will be shared once the manuscript is accepted for publication.</p>
