<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>SoundCubes is a prototype designed to train sound localization skills in children with hearing loss.</p>


<h2>How it works?</h2>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/ChildPointCubes.jpg %}" alt="AI generated image of a child pointing at cubes"/><br><em style="display: block; text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em;">AI generated image</em></span>

The concept is straightforward: the child is surrounded by cubes, each equipped with a loudspeaker. One of the cubes plays a sound stimulus (e.g., a song). The child must identify and pick up the cube they believe is emitting the sound. The selected cube detects the movement and provides feedback based on the correctness of the choice.</p>


<h2>Can I see more?</h2>
<p>The project is at an evaluation phase and more details will be disclosed once the manuscript is accepted to a conference/journal.</p>
