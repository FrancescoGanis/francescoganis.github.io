<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>EmotiCubes is a prototype designed to train emotion recognition skills in children with hearing challenges.</p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<p>Understanding and interpreting emotions is a fundamental skill in human communication. Children with hearing challenges often have difficulties identifying emotions. EmotiCubes aims to help develop these capabilities.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/EmotiCubes_Interaction.png %}" alt="Sketch of a child wondering which emotions is represented."/><br><em style="display: block; text-align: center; font-size: 0.9em;"></em></span></p><p>The prototype is a simple cube that plays recordings of pseudospeech (non-language) with a specific emotion in the voice of the actor. The child has to rotate the cube to align it with the correct emotion depicted on the EmotiCube to select their response. The EmotiCube then provides sound feedback.</p>


<h2>Who is involved?</h2>
<p>This project is part of my PhD at Aalborg University, in collaboration with the <a href="https://melcph.create.aau.dk">Multisensory Experience Lab at Aalborg University</a> and the <a href="https://www.dbspl.nl/">dB SPL Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.umcg.nl/">University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG)</a> - The Netherlands. It is supervised by <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/107881">Prof. Stefania Serafin</a>, <a href="https://research.regionh.dk/da/persons/lone-marianne-percy-smith">Prof. Lone Percy-Smith</a>, and <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/adj">Assistant Prof. Ali Adjorlu</a>.</p>

<h2>What have I learned?</h2>
<p>I designed, developed, programmed, and built the system. I learned about emotions identification, prototyping with children, laser-cutting, 3D printing, embedded programming, and data analysis. Everything with a focus on sound, of course.</p> 

<h2>Can I see more?</h2>
<p>The project is currently in the evaluation phase. More details will be shared once the manuscript is accepted for publication. Please contact me directly for info.</p>
